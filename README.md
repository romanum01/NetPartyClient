# NetPartyClient

This project aims to solve the problem of live social events during a situation such as a quarantine. The browser-based software would function as a medium for people to host parties and social events online if they are unable to in person. We didn't end up completely finishing it, so we made a wireframe design of what it would have been. The website is semi-functional, if you hit join room it will take you too the party page, where you can great a video room. Going through the signup and login forms will also take you there, which is the only thing they can do right now.

Backend 1 (used for creating room id's): 
Backend 2 (we never ended up using this one but we planned to have it handle everything else): https://github.com/LeviHarrison/NetPartyBackend2
